## About
This is a command line program that creates a team profile from user input.

## Use
To run this app you need node.js installed on your machine.

Once the app is on your machine open up your command prompt and cd into the directory with the app.

Once inside the app directory cd in to the Develop folder and then run the command:

node index.js

You will then be prompted to enter a team name.

Once you enter a team name you will be prompted to enter information about each employee that you wish to add to the profile.

After each team member it will ask you if you want to enter another employee, if you select yes it will prompt you to enter info for another employee.
If you select no it will generate your html profile under a file that is your team name.html within the app files.
